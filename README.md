## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used this project to refresh my knowledge on the working principles of flexbox
and css grid. I was also able to get the mobile navigation to work by utilizing
javascript

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working
through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you
want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

### Continued development

I would like to refine my knowledge on dom manipulation using javascript as
straighten out the kinks of css flexbox and css grid.

### Useful resources

- [DOM classname property](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_html_classname.asp) -
  This helped me for utilize the classname property effectively. I really liked
  this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Brad Traversy flexbox crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YW65K6LcIA) -
  This is an amazing video that explained flexbox in a way that I had previously
  not understood it. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
